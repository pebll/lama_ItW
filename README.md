## Note:
We worked on this project in Google Colab, using jupyter notebooks
Here are all our code and result

## Content:
- ReadMe.txt
- ItW_FederatedBasics.ipynb
- ItW_template_FlowerClient.ipynb
- ItW_template_imbalance.ipynb
- results_merged.xlsx
- UeberlegungParameterTraining.xlsx
- Slides_LAMA_ItW.pdf

## Context:
### ItW_FederatedBasics: 
You will find more explanations about the code which we wrote, why we had to do. This was the file in which we got our code working, so that we could proceed with our template file, which we created for fast parameter change.
### ItW_template_FlowerClient:
This is the template we were just writing about above. It tells you what to do inside the one markdown-cell on top.
### ITW_template_imbalance:
At the end we were short on time, so we kind-of splitted our main file to work on separate things. This version of the template also implements the imbalance creation
### results_merged:
The results on which we based our conclusions, aka the file in which the output of our model was automatically saved.
### UeberlegungParameterTraining:
Thoughts about and Documentation of our model-training. More as a second backup for which Params we changed and why.
### Slides_LAMA_ItW:
A pdf-File of our Slides of our presentation.
